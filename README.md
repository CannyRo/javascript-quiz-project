## Overview

Welcome to your first mini-project at Ironhack! This mini-project is designed to help you practice JavaScript, OOP, and DOM and use them together to build a simple web application.

Your task will be to create a Quiz app that runs in the browser. The app should display a list of questions, allow the user to answer the question by selecting an answer, and show the final score after the user completes the quiz. We will return to this in a moment and explain the requirements in more detail, but first, let’s explain how the project is structured.


## The challenge

A mini-project is a multi-day exercise designed to help you practice and gain practical experience with the concepts and skills taught in class. You will develop your mini-project in increments, gradually putting together the concepts you learn each day into a larger whole to eventually get a finished product. This approach will allow you to better understand each concept you learn and its purpose in the broader context of web development. Each day is designed to help you practice and apply the new concepts and skills you have learned that day to your project.

The mini-project serves as a preparation for the module project, which you will be working on at the end of the module. Think of it as a practice run or “warm-up” before the main project.
